# NWO-TRAIN

## Prototype deployment of IKNL-like Personal Health Train infrastructure.

### Requirements
VM or real box containing (preferred) Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

At least 16GB RAM.

At least 1 GPU if at all possible.

Fast access storage of at least 20GB but as much as possible - more is always better.

### Docker Community Edition

Install Docker Engine relevant to your machine, it should be one of these below. Ubuntu is preferred but use whatever fits your system.

[Windows 10](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

[Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

[Mac OS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

Set up docker with the instructions from [docs.docker.com](docs.docker.com).

Check the installation is fine by running the simple hello-docker application.


### python

We need a minimum of version 3.6 or higher. For windows, we recommend the Anaconda version. In Ubuntu, it does not seem to matter much so take the version that comes with Ubuntu.


### ppDLI installation

#### Windows 10 (in anaconda command window) :
mkdir ~/venv

python3 -m venv ~/venv/ppDLI (or maybe just python -m venv ~/venv/ppDLI)

source ~/venv/ppDLI/bin/activate

pip install ppdli

#### Ubuntu (a few more intermediate steps needed) :
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install git python3-venv python3-pip python3-dev postgresql gcc libpq-dev

mkdir ~/venv

python3 -m venv ~/venv/ppDLI

source ~/venv/ppDLI/bin/activate

pip install --upgrade pip

pip install psycopg2==2.7.7

pip install ppdli


### ppDLI node-side configuration thanks to Johan van Soest
Activate the environment you created during the install, see above steps for installing ppDLI library.

It may be that you did not create an environment for the install, it should still work :

ppnode new (unless already created a configuration file for the node)

Give your node configuration an understandable label eg my-config-for-atomCAT.

Enter the api-key given to you by the server operator (you must contact the server operator).

Enter the base-URL of the server (eg http://13.94.188.17)

Enter port to which the server listens: 5000

Path of the api: /api

Database path:?

Defaults for the rest are fine.

(to start broadcasting as the node) ppnode start

(then select which node configuration you want to connect with eg my-config-for-atomCAT)

(if you want to see where ppDLI keeps your configs) ppnode files

(if you just want to see the help page) ppnode

You should now be able to contact the server operator and check if you are connected. A researcher can poll the server
and ask your node to pull a test docker from dockerhub to run (for example, the old fashioned hello-world docker).

### atomCAT docker-compose (optional)

The docker-compose.yml file in the atomCAT folder will spin up local instances of pgAdmin4, postgreSQL, juPyter notebook, R2RML and GraphDB all in one single deployment.

### Radiomics (O-RAW)

More to follow later.

### XNAT docker instance

For a local imaging repository we will use XNAT running as another docker. This will facility deep learning and radiomics for imaging.
The version we will use is this [one](https://github.com/NrgXnat/xnat-docker-compose). Bugs with port 22 conflict and postgres superuser unspecified appear to have been repaired as of July 2020.
